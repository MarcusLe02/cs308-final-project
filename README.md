# cs308-final-project
<h3>Overview</h3>
A command-line adventure game named World War II, inspired by the classic Russian Roulette with extra adjustments. Specifically, in the game the player will fight against each NPC with increased difficulty, defeating the last NPC (final boss aka Hitler) is their completion of the game (The world will be in peace yay!).<br>
Each match in the game is like Russian Roulette, where the player and the NPC alternatively pick up a gun with a bullet in one of six chambers, randomly spin it, and then shoot themselves until the first one dies. I also add a few elements in the game to add to the strategy and difficulty of the game like shopping, where the player and NPC could purchase buff or debuff cards in advantaging their game or disadvantaging the opponentâ€™s game. For example, the player could choose to fold the gun or force the opponent to add an extra bullet in their turn.
